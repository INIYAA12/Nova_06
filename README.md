**SkillSync** is a premium, glassmorphic React dashboard web application tailored for the Bannari Amman Institute of Technology (BIT). It functions as a robust peer-to-peer mentorship ecosystem. Students can find faculty-verified peer mentors, book learning sessions, teach their skills, and level up their student credentials.

This project is a modern, responsive frontend single-page application built using Vite, CSS, React, and Lucide Icons.
